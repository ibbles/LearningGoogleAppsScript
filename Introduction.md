Apps Script is a JavaScript runtime and an API for manipulating Google Sheets documents.
Used to:
- Add functions that can be called from cell equations.
- Access external data-sources.
- Export data to web services.
- Automate operations.

The editor is opened with Top Menu Bar > Extensions > Apps Scripts.
Will open the script editor in a new browser tab.

Can also create a new script from Google Drive > right-click > More > Google Apps Script.
If you create it this way then you get an [[Apps Script Library]] that needs to be associated with each [[Spreadsheet]] that needs to use it.
