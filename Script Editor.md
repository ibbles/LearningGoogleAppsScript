The App Script Editor is where we write and manage our App Scripts.
It is an IDE build into Google Sheets and many other Google services.
The Script Editor is opened with Top Menu Bar > Tools > Script Editor.
The Script Editor opens in a separate browser tab.

The Script Editor always displays a project.
By default it is a project associated with the document from which it was opened.
It is also possible to create a stand-alone project, a so called [[Apps Script Library]].
If the editor is for an [[Apps Script Library]] then the library must be deployed before it can be used by Google Sheets documents.

A project contains `.gs` files that contains our script code.
The `.gs` files are listed in the left side panel, along with any other files we may have created for our project such as [[HTML Popup|HTML]] documents.
